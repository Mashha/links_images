    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>
      Links are found in all pages. They can be an image or any other HTML
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anchor element ( a tag ) together with the
      <strong>href</strong>
      attribute creates a hyperlink. Without it it would be just plain text, and
      it wouldn't do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example above, we added the attribute name, which is
      <strong>href</strong>
      and the value
      <strong>"../index.html"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The part that does not change one the website is the
      <strong>Go home</strong>
      text that you click.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can add an anchor element on it's own or nest it in another HTML
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know absolute and relative links. Absolute links always include the
      domain name of the site with http://www; where relative links show the
      path to the file.
    </p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>
      Image element looks like this
      <img />
      on it's own. It does not have a closing tag. Because it is not really a
      container where we would put text in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do use HTML attribute - src - as in source; which points to the URL of
      the image.
    </p>
    <p>Just like with anchor element, we add name and value here too.</p>
